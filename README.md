# GIS Education Dashboard

**A comprehensive curriculum-aligned geospatial data portal for UAE and MENA education**

## Overview

This dashboard serves as a foundational resource hub for educators and students across the UAE and MENA region, providing pre-made, curriculum-ready GIS materials that integrate with AP, IB, and GCSE diploma programs.

## Project Goals

### For Educators
- Provide pre-made, curriculum-ready GIS materials for immediate classroom integration
- Support three major diploma programs: AP (Advanced Placement), IB (International Baccalaureate), and GCSE
- Enable teachers without extensive GIS backgrounds to incorporate spatial thinking into their subjects

### For Students
- Offer curated datasets specifically relevant to UAE and MENA contexts
- Connect academic concepts from international curricula to local and regional geography
- Provide hands-on GIS analysis opportunities using familiar, locally-relevant data

### Strategic Vision
Transform how students understand their region by applying international academic frameworks to UAE and MENA geography, fostering a generation of spatial thinkers who can contribute to intelligent regional development.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5** with semantic markup
- **CSS3** with modern gradient design and responsive layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for dynamic content loading

### Backend Processing
- **Python 3** for curriculum extraction
- **PyPDF2** with PyCryptodome for encrypted PDF support
- **JSON** for structured data storage

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install PyPDF2 pycryptodome
```

### Running the Dashboard
1. **Start a local server:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/paulstrootman/Documents/GIS Curriculum"
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/homepage.HTML
   ```

3. **Use the dashboard:**
   - Select diploma program (AP, IB, or GCSE)
   - Choose a course (‚òÖ indicates high GIS potential)
   - Select relevant units and topics
   - Pick data variables for your analysis
   - Download your customized GIS data package

## Curriculum Extraction Pipeline

### Phase 1: PDF Processing
```bash
python3 extract_curriculum.py
```
- Scans 83 PDFs across three diploma programs
- Extracts course titles, units, and topics
- Handles encrypted PDFs with PyCryptodome
- Outputs `curriculum_data.json`

### Phase 2: Curation
- Manual refinement of high-GIS-potential courses
- Addition of detailed unit structures
- UAE/MENA contextualization
- Results in `curated_curriculum_data.json`

### Phase 3: Dashboard Generation
```bash
python3 generate_dashboard_js.py
```
- Converts JSON to JavaScript
- Creates dynamic course loader
- Generates `dashboard.js`

### Phase 4: Integration
- Enhanced HTML with modern UI
- Responsive CSS design
- Dynamic content population
- Interactive unit selection
