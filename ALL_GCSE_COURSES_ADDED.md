## üéØ GCSE GIS Potential Analysis

### **Distribution by GIS Integration Potential**

| Level | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **High** | 0 | 0% |
| **Medium** | 3 | 20% |
| **Low** | 12 | 80% |

### **Medium GIS Potential Courses**
- **Business** - Market analysis, location planning, trade patterns
- **Psychology** - Social mapping, behavioral geography
- **Sociology** - Demographic patterns, urban development

### **Why No High GIS Courses?**
Unlike AP (Human Geography) and IB (Environmental Systems & Societies), GCSE doesn't offer a dedicated geography course in this collection. However, several courses have good potential for GIS integration through:
- Business: Market geography and location analysis
- Psychology: Spatial behavior and environmental psychology
- Sociology: Urban development and demographic mapping
- Ancient History: Historical geography and settlement patterns
- Geology: Earth science and environmental mapping

## üìà Extraction Quality Report

### **Successful Unit Extractions (6/15 = 40%)**

Courses with clear topic/unit structures extracted:
1. **Psychology** - Structured topic breakdown
2. **Sociology** - Clear unit organization
3. **Business** - Topic-based structure
4. **Film Studies** - Component breakdown
5. **Media Studies** - Unit structure
6. **Ancient History** - Period-based topics

### **Default Structure (9/15 = 60%)**

Courses using "Course Content" default structure:
- Design Technology
- Electronics
- Engineering
- Classical Civilisation
- Physical Education Short Course
- Astronomy GCSE Subject Content
- Geology
- Statistics
- Subject (General Studies)

**Reason**: Many GCSE PDFs were brief specifications rather than full course guides, lacking detailed unit breakdowns.

### **Overall Quality: Good**
While 40% extraction rate is lower than AP (94%), the GCSE courses still provide valuable curriculum alignment and subject coverage for the dashboard.
